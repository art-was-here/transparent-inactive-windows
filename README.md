## Transparent Inactive Windows
by: art-was-here

### Intro

This is a simple Gnome extension to make inactive windows semi-transparent. This is a built in feature of Hyprland, my normal desktop environment, and all the other extensions available for Gnome for transparency options do not work on Gnome 48. So...I made this. I even added a fancy fade animation so its not so jarring when windows switch between different opacities.

### Planned Features

[x] Transparent inactive windows
[x] Transparent fade animation
[ ] Apply transparency to ALL windows
[ ] Increase/Decrease animation speed
[ ] Switch transparency to percentage slider

### Link to Gnome Extensions
